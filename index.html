        <p>Jollof rice is a classic Nigerian rice dish flavoured with tomatoes, peppers, and lots of seasonings. For those of you who dont know; I am a <strong>rice fiend!</strong> I could eat rice 100 times a day and still not be satisfied.one of my all time favourite rice dishes is a classic Nigerian dish that i grew up eating called <em>Jollof Rice</em></p>
        <p>Jollof rice is a <strong>West African</strong> dish that is a staple in most households. It definitely was a staple in my house growing up, and at parties, where you can be rest assured that there will be pans of it. This is the first reason i love attending <strong>Nigerian parties</strong>.</p>
        <h2>How to cook a delicious Jollof Rice</h2>
        <p>There are many different ways to cook <em>Jollof rice</em> It is a dish made with;
        <ul type="circle"><li>Rice</li> <br>

    <li>Sachet/Tin tomato paste</li> <br>
<li>Scotch bonnet peppers</li> <br>

<p>If your jollof rice dosen't have the above mentioned ingredients, then it's not a true jollof. I usually make it the way my mom taught me, and i usually call it Nigerian jollof because of the type of rice that is used. Nigerians use the lond grain rice that has been parboiled. other versions i.e Ghanaian jollof will use <em>basmati</em> or <em>jasmine</em> rice.</p>
<h3>Tips on cooking the best jollof rie</h3>
<p>
    <ol type="1"><li> It is best to use parboiled rice so that you don't end up with mushy rice.</li>  <br>
    <li> When cooking the tomato stew, you can tell when it's done because the oil will rise to the top. It will be a deep red color and the bitter taste of the tomato has been cooked out </li> <br>
    <li>Reserve 1/4th of the tomato mixture and add it at end to help prevent the rice from burning. Also, it gives the rice that beautiful red color we all know and Love.</li> <br>
    <li>Cover the top of the pot with plastic wrap before putting the lid on to help keep all the steam in the pot.</li> </ol>
